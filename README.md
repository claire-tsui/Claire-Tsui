Iâ€™m currently a junior at UCSD, majoring in Applied Math, with a minor in Computer Science. As I thrive on unraveling complexchallenges through the 
numbers and equations, I simultaneously navigate the digital realm and bring innovation to life. My interests span web development, data analysis, 
and the actuarial profession, and am receptive to embracing new experiences. 

As I progress in my career, I am excited to leverage the knowledge and skills acquired from the internship and academic 
endeavors to continue building innovative and impactful digital solutions.
